The Game Board

General Layout
-----------------

The map is a grid with two players that are separated by their side.The Combiner, Cutter, Oven, Roller, Sauce that are randomly place on the top and bottom row on the map.
The player have to figure out a way to programed their AI to go any station that they need. Note that the (X,Y) representation of the map follows "display" logic, where an increase in X represents a movement towards the 
Right but an increase in Y represents a downward movement. Also note the "backwards" degree rotation where an increase in degrees 
moves counter-clockwise (see movement controller).
