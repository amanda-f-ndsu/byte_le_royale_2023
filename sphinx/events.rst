Infestation
---------------------

Oh my! The computer mice have attacked! These fiends are dastardly hungry,
and will decay your toppings faster. So put on your running shoes, and hop
to it. Hurry up and bake bake bake before it's too late late late!
 
 
Electrical
---------------------

Pizza World, also known as "Papa John's Day of Reckoning" has hired a complete doofus for their electrician. The management's
love for creating pizza has made them blind to all practical limitations in the world. You could say that they look at life
through pizza-tinted glasses. Little would they know, their pizza-tinted glasses would hamper the cooks ability to make pizza!
In the 22nd century BC-BCE-AC-ACE, electricity is needed to make pizza! At this point in human history, society has completely
forgot how to cook anything with natural fire or flame, and same goes for the wonderful Pizza World. Whenever our dummy
electrician messes up, it could be time to shift attention to something else (use your big brain to figure this out). 
NOTE: Any pizza that is an oven that loses power will be destroyed.
 
Wet floors
---------------------

If there is one thing the big elites at Pizza World do not want, and that's a big lawsuit. Through the use of mental subliminal torture machines, that spurt daily affirmations of
workplace encouragement to help the workers at Pizza World become more extensions of the company than they are humans, the cooks are terrified of any little bit of water
that appears on the floor even if it's just a drop. Due to this mental programming that the company has done, you are not able to enter any tile that has water on the floor, even
if it is just a tiny tiny little bitsy itsy little bit.

Event timing
---------------------

Events happen twice per game, Once when the game is roughly 1/3rd of the way through and another when it is roughly 2/3rd's of the way through. Events vary slightly when they start
based on game map.
