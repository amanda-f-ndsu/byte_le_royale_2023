Movement Controller
=====================

Important Notes
---------------

The Movement controller will move the cooks around the kitchen. 
The cooks can only move one tile at a time.

Example
-------
.. code-block:: python

    # Moving up
    # cook current position is (3,3)
    action.chosen_action = ActionType.Move.up
    # cook current position is (4,3)

.. code-block:: python

    # Moving down
    # cook current position is (3,3)
    action.chosen_action = ActionType.Move.down
    # cook current position is (2,3)

.. code-block:: python

    # Moving left
    # cook current position is (3,3)
    action.chosen_action = ActionType.Move.left
    # cook current position is (3,2)

.. code-block:: python

    # Moving right
    # cook current position is (3,3)
    action.chosen_action = ActionType.Move.right
    # cook current position is (3,2)
