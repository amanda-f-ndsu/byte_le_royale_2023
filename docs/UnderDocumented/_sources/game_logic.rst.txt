Cook options during turns
--------------------------

Each turn, a cook can do two things. You can choose to move the cook and then choose if you want to interact with an adjacent station in that order.

Other Logic
-------------

After the cook has been given the chance to move and interact, dispenser will dispense a new topping. After this, event logic will take place. This means that a new event will start if one is meant to start during that turn.
