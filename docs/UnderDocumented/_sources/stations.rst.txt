The combiner takes a rolled pizza object. After it has the pizza, you can add toppings by holding a cut topping and calling the interact
action infront of the combiner. Pizzas can have up to 4 toppings. Calling interact infront of the Combiner without an item will take the 
pizza off of it. The first topping must always be cheese.

This state of the art contraption was made by the amazing scientists at the highest "Pizza League" colleges throughout 
the Dominoes-TacoBell-Corpo-State. Instead of picking up items and placing them on pizzas, the combiner allows for an efficient way
to astrally project the idea of a topping onto a pizza by using life energy from the companies very willing and consentual employees. 
Willing employees *(for a 5% discount on purchases from Pizza World franchises)* sit in a booth overnight and are sucked of life energy to fuel the 
super duper combiner.
