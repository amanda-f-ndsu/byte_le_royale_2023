# Bytiser Readme
- Visualiser with the goal of being able to use it for each year
- Currently implemented with pygame

# Command Line Controls
## First adapt the logs into a graphical json
- python undercooked_adapter.py logsFolder outputFile
## Then run the bytiser to show the graphical json
- python bytiser.py config.json inputFromAdapter.json
- Both bytiser and undercooked_adapter can be passed --help for a help page

## How to use
- Create a config.json
- Use bytiser.run_log(log_path) to visualise a json graphical log

## Graphical Logs
- JSON array of commands
- Each command consists of
    - turn: int
        - Used to track which turn this command is executed as the commands are stored in an array
        - All setup commands would be turn 0 for instance
    - command: string
    - value
## Config
- Note, this code block is commented
- JSON does not allow comments so remove all //comments after copying

## Commands
### add_layer
Adds a layer with the name and z_index, layers are drawn in the order of low to high z_index, width and height are in number of tiles
"command": "add_layer"
"value": ["name", z_index, width, height]
### set_layer
Will clear and then write over the layer with new values, a [null, null] can be optionally included as a default sprite, otherwise will be transparent
Only one default sprite can be included in each set_layer command
"command": "set_layer"
"value": ["name", [
    [null, null, default_key],
    [x, y, key]
]]
### update_layer
Same as set_layer command but does not clear the layer before drawing
"command": "update_layer"
"value": ["name", [
    [null, null, default_key],
    [x, y, key]
]]
### add_score
Will add a score object, give it an id, text, and pixel x and y position
Same as set_layer command but does not clear the layer before drawing
"command": "add_score"
"value": [num_id, "Display Text", inital_value_number, [x, y]]
### set_score
Will set a scores properties, anything left as null will not be changed
If the id is null then all score objects will update
"command": "set_score"
"value": [num_id, "Display Text", [x, y]] 
### remove_score
Will remove a score object and clear it from the screen
If the id is null then all score objects will update
"command": "set_score"
"value": [num_id, "Display Text", [x, y]]

# To Do
- Test ingredients in adapter
- Change to different cook sprites (holding is already done)
- Infection and water tiles
## Visualiser/Art Polish
- File chooser
- Main menu
- Buttons for pause, play, exit
- Slider for faster, slower
- Game End Screen
    - End game command that uses scores
- Walking animations
## Adapter
- Now that the visualiser is mostly done and gamelogs have been generated for us, we can work on a adapter
- The adapter uses a game log and turns it into a log of graphical commands 
- The visualiser uses the graphical commands which means only the adapter needs to be rewritten every year
